        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Beaverhub is a website created by Oregon State University (OSU) that
          acts as a “one-stop hub for tools and resources that support
          [students’] OSU experience” (https://uit.oregonstate.edu/beaver-hub).
          Functionalities listed by OSU themselves are as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Connect with advisors and other members of Success Team</li>
          <li>Access information on class schedule and assignments</li>
          <li>
            Track tasks to complete and access other personalized content that
            supports one’s educational journey
          </li>
          <li>Quickly find offices and resources</li>
          <li>Locate resources and mark them as favorites</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          While Beaverhub <em>does</em> succeed in offering these
          functionalities, the interface it hosts these services on are in need
          of improvement as many OSU students hold negative sentiment towards
          using the resource and/or only use it out of necessity. Thus, this
          redesign project aimed to make Beaverhub's interface more
          user-friendly and customizable, with an overall goal of creating a
          more positive experience for users.

              <p>Identifying a Topic</p>
              <p>
                Given that the main idea of the term project was to redesign an
                interface we were somewhat familiar with and had some potential
                areas of improvement, my group immediately thought of Beaverhub
                as we have all had to use it at one point or another and each
                had our gripes with its interface. We found the following major
                pain points:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Access information on class schedule and assignments</li>
                <li>
                  Track tasks to complete and access other personalized content
                  that supports one’s educational journey
                </li>
                <li>
                  Quickly find offices and resources Locate resources and mark
                  them as favorites
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                However, due to the relatively short period of time we had to
                work on getting a fully-functional and user-tested prototype
                done, we chose to focus on improving Beaverhub’s home/landing
                page as it is the first thing that users see and thus should
                have the most important information displayed in a way that can
                be effectively interpreted.

              <p>Developing User Stories</p>
              <p>
                To combat the fact that the group was composed of members of a
                similar demographic, we developed two user stories to better
                evaluate Beaverhub’s usability. Our first user, Bobby, was
                denoted as the “average” user of Beaverhub as an 18 year-old
                full-time business student attending OSU in-person. Our other
                user, Susan, was denoted as a more “fringe” user of BeaverHub as
                she is a 35-year-old part-time asynchronous Ecampus student
                completing her pre-med path at OSU. When evaluating Beaverhub
                through these users’ lenses, we were able to pinpoint areas of
                improvement that we had either overlooked or hadn’t considered.
                Ultimately, it was apparent to us that even if we try to account
                for as many users as possible, we ultimately are limited by our
                own experiences and perceptions, making it imperative to
                constantly scrutinize our design choices for possible usability
                issues or areas of improvement to accommodate as many users as
                possible.
